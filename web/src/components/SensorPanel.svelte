  // sensor and chart are documented in the task-8 brief's Interfaces block,
  // but that list predates the component: the actual props this component
  // reads are rows/title/flagText/closeLabel/noValue/onclose/chart. `sensor`
  // is not needed here — panelRows already reduced the sensor to `rows`
  // before this component ever runs, and the caller composes `title` from
  // the (non-templated) i18n label plus the sensor id. `chart` stays because
  // Step 7's own code renders it as an optional snippet.
  //
  // `open` is task 9's addition: the panel is mounted once, for the page's
  // lifetime, by islands/panel.js — whether it is SHOWING is a function of
  // whether a sensor is currently selected (viewstate's sensorId resolved
  // through the registry), which changes many times without a remount.
  // Defaults true so this component's own tests (which never pass it) are
  // unaffected: they are about what renders once shown, not about the
  // showing/hiding decision itself, which belongs to the caller that knows
  // about sensorId and the registry.
  //
  // `details` (added with the panel's chart controls) describes the station
  // rather than its readings — hardware, lifetime, coordinates. Defaults to
  // empty so a caller that has nothing to say renders no second list.
  // `meta` (task 12) is the station's EEA classification (EoI code, type,
  // area) — precomposed rows like `details`, but shown directly under the
  // heading rather than behind a disclosure: unlike the hardware inventory,
  // this is what the station IS, not a fact a reader has to open a drawer
  // for. `network` is a single precomposed sentence, the same idiom as
  // `flagText`. Both default empty so every sensor without them (every
  // citizen device today) renders neither block.

<!-- A named region, not a dialog. It was a dialog while it floated over the map,
     where a keyboard user who could not reach the close control was trapped
     behind it; the kit puts this card UNDER the map instead (.place-host), in
     the flow, covering nothing — so dialog semantics would now promise a modal
     that does not exist. Svelte said as much: a <section> cannot carry an
     interactive role. Escape still closes, because the reader whose focus is
     inside the card should not have to Tab back out to the close button. -->
